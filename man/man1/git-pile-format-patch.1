.SH NAME
git-pile \- git pile format-patch
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: git\-pile format\-patch [\-h] [\-o OUTPUT_DIR] [\-f] [\-\-debug] [\-v]
.IP
[REFS [REFS ...]]
.SS "positional arguments:"
.TP
REFS
Same arguments as the ones received by range\-diff in its several forms plus a
shortcut. From more verbose to the easiest ones:
1) OLD_BASELINE..OLD_RESULT_HEAD NEW_BASELINE..NEW_RESULT_HEAD
.TP
This should be used when rebasing the RESULT_BRANCH and thus having
different baselines
.TP
2) OLD_RESULT_HEAD...NEW_RESULT_HEAD or OLD_RESULT_HEAD NEW_RESULT_HEAD
This assumes the baseline remained the same. In the first form, the
same as used by git\-range\-diff, note the triple dots rather than double.
.TP
3) OLD_RESULT_HEAD NEW_RESULT_HEAD
Same as (2)
.TP
3) HEAD or no arguments
This is a shortcut: the current branch will be used as NEW_RESULT_HEAD and
the upstream of this branch as OLD_RESULT_HEAD. Example: if RESULT_BRANCH
is internal, this is equivalent to: internal@{u}...internal
